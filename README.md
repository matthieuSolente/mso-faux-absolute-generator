# mso faux absolute generator
A generator to create vertical absolute positioning for Outlook, without VML


This generator allows you to create a floating or absolute positioning on Outlook without the need to use the VML. The mso mso-element-wrap & mso-element-left properties are the magic properties that position two html components on top of each other. This technique is perfect for creating background images on Outlook. It works very well for vertical absolute positioning but is more difficult to implement for horizontal positioning. All explanations are given on [my other page on the subject](https://github.com/matthieuSolente/mso-faux-absolute).
